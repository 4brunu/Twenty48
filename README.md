# Twenty48

An example project using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) for the UI and C++ for the business logic
via [Djinni](https://github.com/dropbox/djinni)

### Try it Out
It's not done yet but at this point the React can call C++
For now you can:
 ``` 
 git clone --recursive git@github.com:boloutaredoubeni/Twenty48.git 
 ```
